# HandGestureDetection

This program uses a Haar Cascade algorithm to detect the presence of your hand, and then passes it on to a self-created and self-trained Convolutional Neural Network with can classify select gestures, allowing you to use it with a media player to pause/unpause and adjust the volume.
